How to run
1. Open `index.html` in your browser. For full functionality (some browsers block local video), serve via a static server.

Optional: run a simple static server (Python) from project root:
```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then open `http://localhost:8000`.

Notes & next steps
- This is frontend-only. For production, add a backend (Node/Express or Flask), database (MongoDB/Firebase), and a payment gateway.
- Replace placeholder images, videos, and text with real assets and branding.
- Add accessibility improvements, tests, and performance optimizations.
